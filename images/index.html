									<h3>A Few Accomplishments</h3>
									<p>My passion for robotics and embedded systems has led me to create innovative projects.My expertise lies in utilizing diverse sensors and motors like IR sensors, joysticks, flame sensors, 3-Axis Acceleration Gyroscope 6DOF Module, Hall Magnetic sensors and DC motors in conjunction using Arduino and ESP32 platforms. Additionally, I possess proficiency in implementing DIO and Port AUTOSAR drivers for TM4C microcontrollers.</p>

												<h4>BOOTLOADER</h4>
												<p>I developed a Bootloader program for the RP2040 microcontroller. This program facilitates the transmission of hex files via UART, allowing any code to be downloaded into the microcontroller's Flash memory, subsequently enabling the execution of the programmed instructions.</p>

												<h4>DOOR LOCKER SECURITY SYSTEM</h4>
												<p>The Door Locker Security System comprises two Electronic Control Units (ECUs). The first ECU, known as the Human-Machine Interface (HMI), is responsible for user interaction, while the second ECU, referred to as the Control ECU, manages system operations and control. For seamless functionality, I implemented several drivers in this project, including Keypad, LCD, DC Motor, UART, Timer, I2C, and External EEPROM.</p>

												<h4>CONTROL THE SPEED OF A DC MOTOR</h4>
												<p>I am utilizing an AVR Microcontroller (Atmega16) with a Potentiometer connected to the MCU through ADC channel 0. The DC Motor speed is regulated via a PWM signal generated from Timer0. The ADC value is constantly displayed on the LCD. Additionally, an External Interrupt (INT1), triggered by a rising edge, is employed to reverse the direction of the motor.</p>

												<h4>STOPWATCH</h4>
												<p>Employing an AVR Microcontroller (Atmega16), Timer 1 operates in CTC Mode to measure the time for the stopwatch. Interrupts are utilized, with INT0 resetting the stopwatch, INT1 pausing the stopwatch, and INT2 resuming the stopwatch.</p>

												<h4>BLACK LINE FOLLOWER ROBOT</h4>
												<p>The concept behind the operation of a line follower is based on the behavior of light. It relies on the contrasting interaction of light with black and white surfaces. White surfaces almost fully reflect light, while black surfaces absorb light entirely. This light behavior serves as the foundation for constructing a line follower robot.</p>

												<h4>UNMANNED VEHICLE WITH ROBOTIC ARM</h4>
												<p>The project aims to design and implement a self-propelled vehicle equipped with an arm to perform tasks in hazardous areas that pose a threat to human life, such as radiation-contaminated zones or areas with potential booby traps to prevent human injury. The movement of the vehicle and the control of the robotic arm are both managed by a set of sensors integrated into a glove.</p>

												<h4>ARDUINO BLUETOOTH CONTROL ROBOT CAR</h4>
												<p>In this project, I designed a Wireless Bluetooth Controlled Robot Car using Arduino. The robotic car can be wirelessly controlled via a smartphone. The smartphone is equipped with an Android app through which users can send direct commands to the robot. The robot is capable of moving forward, backward, left, right, and stopping. The Bluetooth module HC-05 is interfaced with the Arduino for the control of the Bluetooth-controlled robot car.</p>

												<h4>SIMPLE HOME AUTOMATION</h4>
												<p>In this project, I wirelessly controlled lamps using Arduino UNO and the Bluetooth module HC-05. The sample home automation system can be managed remotely via a smartphone. The smartphone, equipped with an Android app, allows users to send commands directly to control the lamps, turning them on or off.</p>

												<h4>Obstacle Avoiding Robot Car </h4>
												<p>Start the car and drive forward. If the ultrasonic sensor detects an obstacle within 30cm, the car should:<br />
													* Immediately decelerate and come to a safe stop (e.g., 20cm).<br />
													* Wait for 1 minute.<br />
													* If the obstacle remains:<br />
														* Perform a U-turn or backup maneuver to avoid the obstacle. (Move backward by 10cm. Drive with semi-circle of D=2m to to the left to avoid obstacle.)<br />
														* Resume driving towards the intended destination, potentially taking a different route.</p>
